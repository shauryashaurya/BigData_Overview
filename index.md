# The Big Data Menagerie

## Mental Model
It helps to think of the the ecosystem as:
* Lightweight, disposable containers
* working on top of 'ephemeral' virtual machines
* that live on physical infrastructure

## Things that a Big Data ecosystem would need one or more:
* worker nodes that actually execute the processing task
* managers that track the jobs
* 'schedulers' that manage how the resources are shared among the jobs
*
